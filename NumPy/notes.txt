NumPy - Numerical Python (module)
for fast numerical computing (uses c inside the hood)
ndArrays (n dimensional arrays) - very fast as compare to python lists

py lists - flexible (can hold diff types of data) - hence, slow, stores metadata as well apart from actual data(takes more memory)

np arrays - homogeneous, optmizied with C - very fast (mathematical operations), optimized in time & space in comparison with py lists, stores data in continous memory blocks, built in mathematical operations & support direct vectorized operations

np array methods:
> np_arr.nbytes - gives the size of np array in bytes
> np_arr.dtype - gives the data type of elements in the array
> np_arr.shape - gives the dimension(m * n) of the array
> np_arr.ndim - total no of dimensions: 1d(1), 2d(2)....
> np_arr.astype(np.float64) - type casting

> np.zeros((x, y)) - prefill with 0s
> np.ones((x, y)) - prefill with 1s
> np.full((x, y), value) - prefill with a value
> np.eye(x) - to create a identity matrix
> np.arange(start, end, step) - range elements (similar to range in py lists)
> np.linspace(start, end, step) - to create evenly spaced arrays

operations:
> np_arr.reshape((y, x)) - reshaping (x, y) np array to (y, x)
> np_arr.flatten() - flattens the array 2D => 1d
> Fancy Indexing - accessing multiple idxs at one time (uses vectorization) - arr[[idxs]]
> Boolean Indexing - filtering on the basis of condition - arr[condition]


slicing: (simliar to lists)
> lists - copy is created(new memory is allocated) - changes doesn't reflect in org list

> np arrays - view is created(no new memory is allocated) - now viewing at a subarray of the orginal array, changes reflect in org array

> copy in np arrays - np_arr[x:y].copy() - copy of view, changes now doesn't relfect to org array

Common Data types:
> Integers - int32, int64
> Floating numbers - float32, float64
> Boolean - bool
> Complex numbers - complex64, complex128
> String - S (byte - str) & U (unicode - str)
> Object: generic python objects - object
